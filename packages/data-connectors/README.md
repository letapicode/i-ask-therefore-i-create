# Data Connectors

Example connectors that third-party services can implement. This package currently includes functional Stripe, Slack, Apple and Google connectors using their HTTP APIs.

TensorFlow.js models can be placed under `model/` and loaded in the browser with `tfHelper.ts` for client-side inference.
Prediction helpers are also exported for server-side endpoints.
