# Federated Training Privacy Dashboard

The privacy dashboard tracks how differential privacy affects model aggregation.
Noise levels and opt-in counts are recorded whenever a model is generated.
View `/privacy-dashboard` in the portal to monitor noise, update totals and
tenant participation. High noise or low opt-in rates may indicate unreliable
training data.
