# Mobile App Generation

The code generation service can optionally produce React Native projects. Templates are stored alongside web templates and selected via the portal wizard.

## Build & Emulator

Install dependencies with `pnpm install` and run `npx expo start` inside the generated app. Use the iOS or Android emulator from Expo to preview the project.
